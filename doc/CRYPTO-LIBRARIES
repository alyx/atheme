Cryptographic Implementation Documentation
------------------------------------------

The following modules are available to encrypt passwords:

  Argon2d (Password Hashing Competition, v1.3)  modules/crypto/argon2d
  PBKDF2 cryptography (better format)           modules/crypto/pbkdf2v2
  POSIX-style crypt(3)                          modules/crypto/posix

It is highly recommended that you load one or more of these modules.

The following modules are available to verify old encrypted passwords:

  PBKDF2 (Atheme <= 7.2 compatibility)          modules/crypto/pbkdf2
  Raw MD5 (Anope ~1.8 compatibility)            modules/crypto/rawmd5
  Raw SHA1 (Anope ~1.8 compatibility)           modules/crypto/rawsha1
  IRCServices (+ Anope) compatibility           modules/crypto/ircservices

All of these modules will compile stand-alone, but they can be accelerated by
installing a cryptographic library and building Atheme against it. Such
libraries provide more efficient digest algorithms than the ones implemented
in Atheme.

The following cryptographic libraries are supported, listed in the preferred
order, along with the configure options to control them:

  ARM mbedTLS           (--with-mbedtls)
  OpenSSL (& LibreSSL)  (--with-openssl)

When you configure this program, it will say which libraries it detected and
which one it is going to use for cryptographic acceleration; like so:

  Configuration:
      Atheme Version ..........: 7.3.0-dev
      ARM mbedTLS Support .....: Yes
      OpenSSL Support .........: No
      Digest Frontend .........: ARM mbedTLS

All supported cryptographic libraries will be autodetected by default, and
their absense is not an error unless the user explicitly asked to build
against them with one of the configure options listed above.

If you would like to override the order (for example, you have ARM mbedTLS
and OpenSSL installed, and you would like to use OpenSSL), you can prevent
Atheme from checking for the unwanted libraries by using the configure
options listed above, but with an argument of "no". Alternatively, you can
use e.g. '--without-mbedtls' instead of '--with-mbedtls=no'.

The following modules are listed with their specific requirements. If you do
not have the necessary library installed, the module will not load:

  modules/saslserv/ecdsa-nist256p-challenge: requires OpenSSL (or LibreSSL)
                                             + with elliptic curve support
